When transporting signals from one nerve cell (neuron) to another, the most common way is by means of diffusion of molecules called \textit{neurotransmitters}, across the synaptic cleft. Since this process is governed by diffusion, it means we can describe it mathematically by

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 u,
\label{EQ1}
\end{equation}
